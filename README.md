steps to create the app

Html contains a nav Ul with an id beer_list
two forms with a label and textarea and button to update and submit reviews
Script file which makes the file dynamic by adding functionality
run json server with $ json-server --watch db.json
"http://localhost:3000/beers"; store the url in beerApi
then fetch data
create h2 and image with createElement method to render data into the html
